# Operational Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike

## Introduction

Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. One of the key aspects of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales.


## Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

In Case Study 1, we will explore the "job_data" table, which contains vital information about jobs, actors, events, languages, time spent, organizations, and dates. Our goal is to gain valuable insights from this data to improve our understanding of job reviews and their impact on daily operations.

### Jobs Reviewed Over Time

We will start by calculating the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020. This analysis will help us identify patterns in job reviews and their variations over time.

### Throughput Analysis

Next, we will dive into calculating the 7-day rolling average of throughput, which refers to the number of events per second. Additionally, we will discuss the preference of using either daily metrics or 7-day rolling averages for throughput analysis and the reasons behind our choice.

### Language Share Analysis

In this task, we will calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days. This analysis will provide valuable insights into language preferences among users and can help us make data-driven decisions regarding content localization and targeting.

### Duplicate Rows Detection

Lastly, we will identify duplicate rows in the "job_data" table and display them. Detecting duplicates is crucial for ensuring data quality and integrity, and this analysis will assist us in maintaining a clean and reliable dataset.

## Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike

Case Study 2 revolves around three key tables: "users," "events," and "email_events." We will conduct a detailed investigation to better understand user engagement and interactions with the email service.

### Weekly User Engagement

Our first task will involve measuring user engagement on a weekly basis. Understanding the activeness of users will provide valuable insights into their interaction patterns, enabling us to enhance user experiences and identify areas for improvement.

### User Growth Analysis

Next, we will analyze the growth of users over time for our product. This analysis is crucial for tracking user acquisition trends and identifying potential growth opportunities.

### Weekly Retention Analysis

Analyzing the weekly retention of users who signed up for our product will help us gauge user loyalty and understand the product's stickiness. We will explore how many users continue to engage with the product after their initial sign-up.

### Weekly Engagement Per Device

Measuring weekly engagement per device will provide insights into users' preferred devices for interacting with our product. This information can influence our product development strategies and user experience optimization.

### Email Engagement Analysis

Finally, we will dive into how users are engaging with our email service. Analyzing email interactions will help us evaluate the effectiveness of our communication strategies and identify ways to enhance user engagement.

Throughout both case studies, we will provide detailed insights and interpretations of our findings, empowering stakeholders and decision-makers to make informed choices and drive positive outcomes. Let's embark on this journey of data exploration and analysis, making a significant impact on our operational strategies! ðŸ“ŠðŸš€
