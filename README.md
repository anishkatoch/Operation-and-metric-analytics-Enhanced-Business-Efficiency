Welcome to the Operational Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike project! In this project, we will explore the fascinating world of data analytics and delve into the art of deciphering insights from complex datasets. As a data analyst, I am eager to share my knowledge and expertise with you.

## Project Overview

Operational Analytics is a powerful process that involves the systematic analysis of an organization's operational data to gain valuable insights and improve overall efficiency and performance. It encompasses the use of various data analysis techniques and tools to optimize business processes, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.

In today's data-driven world, businesses generate vast amounts of data through their day-to-day operations. This data comes from various sources, including customer interactions, transactions, supply chain activities, employee performance, and more. Operational Analytics allows organizations to harness this data to better understand their operations, identify patterns and trends, and gain a competitive edge in the market.

The primary goal of Operational Analytics is to provide actionable insights that can lead to better decision-making and enhanced operational performance. By analyzing historical and real-time data, organizations can identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization. This, in turn, helps in streamlining processes, reducing costs, improving customer satisfaction, and ultimately increasing profitability.

Key benefits of Operational Analytics include:

- Data-Driven Decision Making: Organizations can make informed decisions backed by data rather than relying on intuition or gut feelings.
- Real-Time Insights: With the ability to analyze real-time data, businesses can respond quickly to changing market conditions and operational challenges.
- Process Optimization: Operational Analytics helps identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks in processes, enabling organizations to optimize workflows and improve productivity.
- Predictive Analytics: By leveraging historical data, organizations can employ predictive analytics to anticipate future trends and outcomes.
- Continuous Improvement: Regularly analyzing operational data facilitates a culture of continuous improvement within the organization.

## Analysis:
-  It  is conducted using SQL software and involves writing queries to extract insights from the dataset. Analytical skills are crucial for crafting correct queries to answer specific questions.

-  For example, to determine the number of jobs reviewed in a month, queries extract dates for the specified year and use the DISTINCT function to identify unique user IDs responsible for the work.

-  In the case of throughput analysis, metrics are calculated to reveal the rate of events occurring per second. Previous data calculations are used to find the number of jobs reviewed in a week. Filtering by date ranges is achieved using the WHERE function.

-  To calculate the percentage share of each language, data from jobs reviewed is necessary, and languages are counted based on distinct user IDs.

-  Detecting duplicate data involves using the PARTITION function to assign different row numbers to each unique ID.

-  Weekly engagement analysis employs various functions to extract desired results. Dates within specified periods are extracted, and queries are designed to calculate weekly user engagement.

-  The answers to other questions are similarly derived through the formulation of appropriate queries, all following a structured analytical approach.


## Conclusion:



-  Operational Analytics plays a pivotal role by harmonizing real-time data.
-  It possesses the capability to aggregate data from diverse sources into a unified, structured, actionable solution that can generate analytical models in real-time.
-  This, in turn, helps in creating individual customer profiles and provides a comprehensive view of a company's operations.
-  This ensures that operational processes and systems are utilized efficiently, resulting in a significant positive impact on the efficiency of specific areas.




## Limitations:



-  The project relies on the availability and quality of operational data. If data is incomplete, inaccurate, or not up to date, it can impact the accuracy of the insights generated.

-  The project focuses on specific cases, and the insights derived may not cover all aspects of operational analytics. There are many other potential use cases and analyses that could provide additional insights.

-  The insights and recommendations made in the project are specific to the datasets and cases analyzed. They may not be directly applicable to other organizations or industries without further customization and analysis.

-  Implementing certain aspects of operational analytics, such as real-time monitoring and dashboard creation, may require technical expertise and resources that not all organizations possess.

-  Handling sensitive operational data requires strict adherence to privacy and security regulations. Ensuring that data is anonymized and protected is essential to avoid legal and ethical issues.





## Challenges:



-  Handling and processing large volumes of data, especially in Case Study 2, presented a significant challenge. Importing massive datasets into SQL Workbench was slow, and overcoming this required the use of specialized loading techniques.

-  In Case Study 2, the 'user_type' column in the 'events' table had an integer datatype, which posed difficulties during data import. Changing the datatype to 'text' was necessary to facilitate the data loading process.

-  Analyzing complex datasets and extracting meaningful insights can be challenging. Understanding the relationships between different data points and identifying relevant patterns and trends requires advanced analytical skills.

-  Operational analytics often involves aggregating data from various sources. Ensuring that these diverse datasets are integrated seamlessly and accurately can be a complex task.

-  While operational analytics aims to provide real-time insights, implementing a truly real-time dashboard and monitoring system can be technically challenging and resource-intensive.
