# Operational Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike

## Introduction

Welcome to the Operational Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike project! Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. One of the key aspects of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales.

## Project Overview

Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations to identify areas for improvement. As a Data Analyst, you will work closely with different teams, including operations, support, and marketing, to help them extract valuable insights from the data they collect.

One critical aspect of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As a Data Analyst, you will be required to answer these questions daily, making it crucial to understand how to investigate these metric spikes.

## Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

In this case study, you will be working with a table named "job_data" with columns like job_id, actor_id, event, language, time_spent, org, and ds. Your tasks in this case study include:

1. **Jobs Reviewed Over Time**: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.

2. **Throughput Analysis**: Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second) and discuss the preference of using daily metrics or 7-day rolling average for throughput.

3. **Language Share Analysis**: Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.

4. **Duplicate Rows Detection**: Identify duplicate rows in the data and display them from the job_data table.

## Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike

In this case study, you will be working with three tables: "users," "events," and "email_events." Your tasks in this case study include:

1. **Weekly User Engagement**: Measure the activeness of users on a weekly basis.

2. **User Growth Analysis**: Analyze the growth of users over time for a product.

3. **Weekly Retention Analysis**: Analyze the retention of users on a weekly basis after signing up for a product.

4. **Weekly Engagement Per Device**: Measure the activeness of users on a weekly basis per device.

5. **Email Engagement Analysis**: Analyze how users are engaging with the email service.

## Insights and Interpretations

For each task, it is essential to provide detailed insights and interpretations of the results obtained from your SQL queries. These insights will help stakeholders and decision-makers understand the implications of the data and guide them in making informed business decisions.
